# Flack Messaging Application

Flack is a web-based messaging platform, where users can create a username, a channel, and connect with anyone. All channels are public, thus anyone can enter and start chatting. An unlimited number of channels can be created, and there is no limit to how many users can be in each channel. Each person's avatar is generated via their username, and a person's profile is remembered once a profile is created.
